It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal-line. This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the Penalty Area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them the only players on the field able to handle the ball. Goalkeepers perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch giving them a unique perspective on play development.\\nGoalkeepers are required to remain on the pitch at all times though that does not mean they have to be between the sticks all the time. For example goalkeepers may have to take a penalty kick during a penalty shoot-out or even go for a corner late in the game though it is rare, as it leaves the goal unguarded. If a goalkeeper is hurt or sent off a substitute goalkeeper can take his place, if there isn't a substitute, then an outfielder must do so. In the event of a sending off teams often substitute an outfield player so that a specialist player can come in to the team to effectively replace the sent-off goalkeeper. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their alloted substitutes for the match, an outfield player has to take his place and wear the goalkeeper kit. Because goalkeeper is the most important job in football as well as being the most difficult position to master, most teams have specialist players that only ever play in goal. Goalkeepers appear to have longer playing careers than outfield players, many not retiring until their late thirties or early forties, an example of this beingPeter Shilton who played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997, retiring at the age of 47. The main squad number for a goalkeeper is no.1 but today though this is still common some goalkeepers now wear other squad numbers when in goal. For example: Despite being no.1 at Liverpool, Pepe Reina has worn the no.25 jersey through all his Liverpool career. No.13, especially in Britain, is the common number for the second choice keeper, though others like 12, 16, 24, 25, even 30 are also common."]}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"head": "/m/012zng", "head_name": ["Mike Watt"], "head_text": ["Michael David \\\"Mike\\\" Watt is an American bassist, singer and songwriter.\\nHe is best known for co-founding the rock bands Minutemen, Dos, and Firehose; as of 2003, he is also the bassist for the reunited Stooges and a member of the art rock/jazz/punk/improv group Banyan as well as many other post-Minutemen projects.\\nCMJ New Music called Watt a \\\"seminal post-punk bass player.\\\" In November 2008, Watt received the Bass Player Magazine lifetime achievement award, presented by Flea."], "tail": "/m/01c40n", "tail_name": ["San Pedro"], "tail_text": ["San Pedro is a port district of the city of Los Angeles, California.

Beginning around the 11th century, various Italian cities, communes and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking; concurrently, Italian culture flourished, especially during the Renaissance, which produced many notable scholars, artists, and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. Meanwhile, Italian explorers such as Polo, Columbus, Vespucci, and Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery.

Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship God established with the Children of Israel.\\nJudaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. Historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period; and among segments of the modern reform movements. Liberal movements in modern times such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to Jewish law, the authority of the Rabbinic tradition, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more \\\"traditional\\\" interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, special courts enforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary.

Other variations of Mormonism include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy that were abandoned by the LDS Church, and various other small independent denominations.\\nThe word Mormon is derived from the Book of Mormon, one of the faith's religious texts. Based on the name of that book, early followers of founder Joseph Smith, Jr. were called Mormons, and their faith was called Mormonism. The term was initially considered pejorative, but is no longer considered so by Mormons.\\nMormonism shares a common set of beliefs with the rest of the Latter Day Saint movement, including use of, and belief in, the Bible, as well as other religious texts including the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.

It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal-line. This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the Penalty Area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them the only players on the field able to handle the ball. Goalkeepers perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch giving them a unique perspective on play development.\\nGoalkeepers are required to remain on the pitch at all times though that does not mean they have to be between the sticks all the time. For example goalkeepers may have to take a penalty kick during a penalty shoot-out or even go for a corner late in the game though it is rare, as it leaves the goal unguarded. If a goalkeeper is hurt or sent off a substitute goalkeeper can take his place, if there isn't a substitute, then an outfielder must do so. In the event of a sending off teams often substitute an outfield player so that a specialist player can come in to the team to effectively replace the sent-off goalkeeper. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their alloted substitutes for the match, an outfield player has to take his place and wear the goalkeeper kit. Because goalkeeper is the most important job in football as well as being the most difficult position to master, most teams have specialist players that only ever play in goal. Goalkeepers appear to have longer playing careers than outfield players, many not retiring until their late thirties or early forties, an example of this beingPeter Shilton who played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997, retiring at the age of 47. The main squad number for a goalkeeper is no.1 but today though this is still common some goalkeepers now wear other squad numbers when in goal. For example: Despite being no.1 at Liverpool, Pepe Reina has worn the no.25 jersey through all his Liverpool career. No.13, especially in Britain, is the common number for the second choice keeper, though others like 12, 16, 24, 25, even 30 are also common."]}, {"head": "/m/0lhp1", "head_name": ["Real Zaragoza"], "head_text": ["Real Zaragoza, S.A.D. is a Spanish football team based in Zaragoza, in the autonomous community of Aragon.

Early symptoms are often mistakenly thought to be 'age-related' concerns, or manifestations of stress. In the early stages, the most common symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events, known as short term memory loss. When AD is suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with tests that evaluate behaviour and thinking abilities, often followed by a brain scan if available, however, examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. As the disease advances, symptoms can include confusion, irritability, aggression, mood swings, trouble with language, and long-term memory loss.

It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal-line. This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the Penalty Area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them the only players on the field able to handle the ball. Goalkeepers perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch giving them a unique perspective on play development.\\nGoalkeepers are required to remain on the pitch at all times though that does not mean they have to be between the sticks all the time. For example goalkeepers may have to take a penalty kick during a penalty shoot-out or even go for a corner late in the game though it is rare, as it leaves the goal unguarded. If a goalkeeper is hurt or sent off a substitute goalkeeper can take his place, if there isn't a substitute, then an outfielder must do so. In the event of a sending off teams often substitute an outfield player so that a specialist player can come in to the team to effectively replace the sent-off goalkeeper. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their alloted substitutes for the match, an outfield player has to take his place and wear the goalkeeper kit. Because goalkeeper is the most important job in football as well as being the most difficult position to master, most teams have specialist players that only ever play in goal. Goalkeepers appear to have longer playing careers than outfield players, many not retiring until their late thirties or early forties, an example of this beingPeter Shilton who played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997, retiring at the age of 47. The main squad number for a goalkeeper is no.1 but today though this is still common some goalkeepers now wear other squad numbers when in goal. For example: Despite being no.1 at Liverpool, Pepe Reina has worn the no.25 jersey through all his Liverpool career. No.13, especially in Britain, is the common number for the second choice keeper, though others like 12, 16, 24, 25, even 30 are also common."], "tail": "/m/03x746", "tail_name": ["Lille OSC"], "tail_text": ["LOSC Lille is a French association football club based in Lille.

Typically, fullbacks are larger in size than halfbacks and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back.\\nMany great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks, notably Marion Motley, Jim Brown, Franco Harris, Mike Alstott, Larry Csonka, John Riggins, and Steve Van Buren. Fullbacks are typically known less for speed and agility and more for muscularity and the ability to shed tackles. In the modern NFL, Fullbacks are not usually deployed as ball carriers but are mostly used as a lead blocker to allow smaller, quicker backs to get to the secondary of the opposing team's defense. In the early 2000s, many NFL teams used blocking fullbacks, such as Tony Richardson and Lorenzo Neal, with great success. These backs cleared the way for some of the decade's great running backs. Recently, some teams have actually phased-out fullbacks altogether in favor of two tight end sets. The remaining prominent fullbacks in the NFL such as Ovie Mughelli, Bruce Miller, John Kuhn, Leonard Weaver, Owen Schmitt, Vonta Leach, Marcel Reece, and Henry Hynoski are still employed as lead blockers and do not often carry or catch the ball. In spite of their usually infrequent carries in modern NFL offenses, some fullbacks have actually led their team in rushing.

The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver. Like offensive linemen, they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the other hand, they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense's attention when running pass patterns.\\nBecause of the hybrid nature of the position, the tight end's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman rarely going out for passes. Other systems utilize the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking in running situations while utilizing a better pass catching tight end in obvious passing situations.\\nOffensive formations may have between zero and three tight ends at one time. If a wide receiver is present in a formation, but outside the tight end, the wide receiver must be positioned behind the line of scrimmage.

On the other hand, they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense's attention when running pass patterns.\\nBecause of the hybrid nature of the position, the tight end's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman rarely going out for passes. Other systems utilize the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking in running situations while utilizing a better pass catching tight end in obvious passing situations.\\nOffensive formations may have between zero and three tight ends at one time. If a wide receiver is present in a formation, but outside the tight end, the wide receiver must be positioned behind the line of scrimmage.

The string vibrates at a fundamental frequency but also creates many harmonics at different frequencies. The frequencies produced depend on string length, mass, and tension.

There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\\nDrums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way.

Special variants like the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet.\\nThe word trombone derives from Italian tromba and -one, so the name means \\\"large trumpet\\\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart the baritone and in contrast to its conical valved counterparts, the euphonium and the horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. The most common variant, the tenor, is pitched in B\u266d, an octave below the B\u266d trumpet and an octave above the B\u266d tuba. The once common E\u266d alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now enjoying a resurgence due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works.
